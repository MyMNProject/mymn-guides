for 64bit(Note that version 1.2.1.1 requires the bootstrapping as opposed to previous version. This will be ommited in the future):
https://github.com/MyMNProject/mymn/releases/download/1.2.1.1/mymn-qt-Win64-with-bootstrap.zip

Unzip the file to a folder of your choice. We will assume you are on drive: C:\
